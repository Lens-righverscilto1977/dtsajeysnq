Man, just came out of Screamboat, and my brain feels like it’s been chewed and spit out by a kaleidoscope. I mean, the guy in the second row wouldn’t stop crinkling his candy wrapper right in the middle of the main twist, and my back’s still aching from those ancient theater seats. Cinemas are cursed, I swear like seashells on a blackboard.

The opening scene — absolutely electric, like a cat going berserk in a sock drawer. There was this moment when the boat’s horn was screaming (or was it actually a scream?), and I swear it rattled the popcorn crumbs stuck in my teeth. That main dude — you know, the one with the eyebrows that could tell their own story — was running around like he’d just downloaded a fever dream and hit play. Or maybe pause? Everything felt paused and fast-forwarded at once.

> Can’t forget that one part where the villain (what a name, Captain Shriek, for God’s sakes) gets all poetic; was it genius or nonsense? Like watching someone juggle flaming carrots — captivating but you gotta question why. I know you wanted to download the movie, but trust me, you gotta watch the movie in the theater to get the full, chaotic rollercoaster. Oh, and there was this fish — no, a herring — that kept appearing. Symbolic of what, who knows? Maybe the circular nature of our thoughts or just an editor’s prank.

Then baam the climax fades into some kinda soft jazz moment, like trying to land a plane with butter for wings, and everyone’s just sitting there, barely breathing. The screen dribbles into a weird watercolor dreamscape, and my eyes feel like they’re seeing through a shattered glass window. Everything’s perspective but no direction. The boat, that screamboat (title-making sense now in gibberish ways), somehow emotional like watching a dog learn to salsa in neon rain.

And what was that final line? Something about “the scream only echoes if the heart listens” — ridiculous, right? But, my god, it hits you like yogurt in the face on a Monday morning when you aren’t ready for anything. Cinematic indigestion, I’d call it.

Jostling out with the crowd, some kid’s playing that tune on a rubber ukulele — it’s stuck in my head now and I bet you I’ll hear it whenever I close my eyes tonight.
